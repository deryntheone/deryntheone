                <p>The evening of February 22, 1986 was thick with tension. The nation stood at a crossroads as fear gripped the people. Under the Marcos regime, the press was shackled by censorship, and their voices suppressed under the weight of dictatorship. Yet, amidst this silence, one station challenged the regime.</p>

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Over the airwaves of Radio Veritas, a voice rang out—a call that would awaken the people. “I am calling our people to support our two good friends at the camp. If any of you could be around at Camp Aguinaldo to show your solidarity and your support in this very crucial period, when our two good friends have shown their idealism, I would be very happy if you could support them now.”</p>

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>It was Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, speaking not just to the listeners of Radio Veritas, but to the entire nation. His words would become the spark that ignited the flames of the EDSA People Power Revolution.</p>

                <p><strong>Igniting the spark</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Upon hearing the broadcast, Filipinos quickly flocked to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), determined to support Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Vice Military Chief Fidel V. Ramos.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“People from all walks of life convened [and] gathered in EDSA and along the side street… Over the next few days, the crowd grew from a mere five thousand to almost a million,” recalled Gabby Salcedo, former writer and reporter of Radio Veritas.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Armed with nothing but prayers, flowers, and hope, Filipinos stood hand-in-hand against the dictatorship. In retaliation, the Marcos regime decided to cut off the source of the revolution—Radio Veritas.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“[The soldiers] destroyed the facilities [in Bulacan] after forcing their way in. The broadcast continued for a while, but they were using the emergency transmitter in Fairview," Salcedo recalled. “It only lasted for about the whole day. Eventually, Radio Veritas signed off.”</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>However, the revolution could not be silenced.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Radio Veritas reporter June Keithley-Castro rushed to Sta. Mesa, Manila to take over the DZRJ radio station under the guise of “Radyo Bandido” (Bandit Radio). Unfazed by threats by Marcos, she broadcasted news and updates about the revolution for 14 hours straight, earning her the title “Voice of the Revolution.”</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“We were not afraid, and they shouldn’t be afraid, because there is much that can be done if you’re not afraid,” said Keithley-Castro.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>Uniting forces</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Radio Veritas was not the only media outlet active during the revolution. Filipino newspapers such as the Manila Times, the Daily Bulletin (now the Manila Bulletin), and the Philippine Daily Inquirer documented the events on their front pages. Other radio and television outlets followed, breaking their silence and openly criticizing the dictatorship.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Veteran journalist and Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) trustee Vergel Santos emphasized the significance of Radio Veritas’ role during the EDSA Revolution: “Only one person and one news organization set the mood of the moment during EDSA, and it was Cardinal Sin and Radio Veritas. And we, the rest of the media against Marcos, simply fell in, and decided, as a matter of course, what our goal should be for the moment.”</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Certain media outlets also emerged to question the authoritarian government, such as the We Forum, Malaya, and the Philippine Collegian, the student publication of the University of the Philippines. Following the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr., even more press organizations began to step up and question the administration.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The revolution strengthened the power of the media, allowing the once-silenced press to break free of their shackles and uphold their journalistic duties once more.&nbsp;</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“From that very day, the people were already awakened from their slumber of choosing to be silent [and] oblivious of what's happening around the country: the military abuses, cronyism, [and] corruption,” Salcedo said.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Media coverage fueled unity among Filipinos, strengthening the revolution. The broadcasts and papers persevered with great purpose, bringing information to the hopeful masses.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“Radio Veritas was our main source of information,” said Claretian missionary priest Victor Sadaya. “While the events were unfolding, Radio Veritas was reporting it in other languages that were broadcast around the world.”</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>Keeping the flame</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Thirty-nine years have passed since the EDSA Revolution, yet the Philippine media still faces censorship and harassment to this day. In 2024, the Philippines had a ranking of “difficult” (134 out of 180 countries) in the World Press Freedom Index, with factors such as threats and violence contributing to the ranking.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“The suppression of freedom, of truth, and of justice constitutes an attack on the press by itself. In fact, worse attacks are happening—killings and threats, and all those things,” said Santos.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Aside from attacks on the press, the nation also faces acts of historical distortion under the current administration of Marcos Jr. Since 2024, the EDSA People Power Anniversary has ceased to be a special non-working holiday and has been downgraded to a special working holiday. However, many schools and universities have protested this by suspending their classes on this day.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>“We will continue to commemorate this shining moment in history, when the collective power of the people prevailed over corruption, abuse, lack of accountability among public officials, and social injustice,” writes the De La Salle Philippines (DLSP) in a statement regarding their suspension of classes.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>In an official press release statement from Senator Risa Hontiveros, she writes, “kaya kahit ilang holiday pa ang icancel ng Malakanyang, mananatiling buhay ang diwa at mensahe ng People Power - lalo na sa kabataang Pilipino na naninindigan at nagsasalita para sa kalayaan, hustisya at sama-samang pag asenso.”</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>(“So even if Malacanang continues to cancel holidays, the spirit and message of People Power will remain alive, even in the Filipino youth who stand up and speak out for freedom, justice, and unity towards progress.”)</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The evening of February 22, 1986 was thick with tension, but a single voice cut through the silence and awakened the nation. Decades later, the voices have changed, yet the purpose remains the same—to keep the flame of truth burning in the darkness.</p>
